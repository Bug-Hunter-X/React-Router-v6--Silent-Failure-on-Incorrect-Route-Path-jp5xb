This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where navigating to an incorrect route path results in a blank screen without any error messages.  The `incorrectRoute.js` file shows the problematic code, while `correctRoute.js` provides a solution.  The problem stems from the lack of explicit error handling for invalid routes in v6. This example highlights the importance of using error boundaries or checking the route path before rendering components to improve the user experience and facilitate debugging.
