In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or has a typo in its path.  This results in the application rendering nothing or displaying an unexpected error.  For instance, if a route is defined as `/about` but the user attempts to access `/abou`, React Router will not render anything within the `Outlet` component. This often leads to a blank screen without error messages, making debugging difficult.
